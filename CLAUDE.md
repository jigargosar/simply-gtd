# CLAUDE.md

simply-gtd — a local-only "list-of-lists" GTD app. Foldkit (Effect + Elm architecture), single user, browser storage, no backend.

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` — Foldkit conventions, patterns, and the quality bar. Authoritative; follow it.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — product spec hub: concept, locked decisions, open questions.
- `docs/item-state.md` — two-axis item-state model (D1–D10): `archived` + `done`, delete-as-removal. E1 resolved.
- `repos/foldkit/` — vendored framework subtree; canonical reference. Read-only, never import from it (import from `foldkit`).
- `docs/handover.md` — current implementation status and next steps. Read at the start of each session; update it at the end.

## Model in one line

Board → Sections (titled) → Items (text + done + timestamps). Each entity carries two orthogonal axes — `archived/not-archived` and `done/not-done` (no "active"); delete removes the record (no `deleted` state); visibility derived from own + parent `archived`.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` — Vite dev server
- `pnpm typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`
- `pnpm test` — vitest
- `pnpm lint` — oxlint
- `pnpm format` — prettier

## Rules

- pnpm only. TypeScript strict — no `any`, no `as`, no `!`, no `@ts-ignore`.
- Stay inside Foldkit/Effect; no React, no escape hatches, no two-way binding.
- Model fields are Schema types. Immutable updates via `evo()` — never spread.
- Messages are facts, never commands; never `NoOp`.
- Board mockup lives at `docs/mockups/board-mock.html`.
- Never read, list, or search `docs/_archive/` — not in the working tree, and not via git history (no `git log`, `git show`, `git diff`, `git cat-file`, or any command that surfaces its past or deleted contents). If its content ever surfaces incidentally (search hits, diff output), ignore it and base no decision on it. Treat the path as off-limits everywhere — do not add it to ignore files; the ban is behavioral.
- NEVER use worktrees. Do not call EnterWorktree; work in the shared checkout. Banned until the user explicitly lifts this.
- Foldkit devtools MCP debugging: see `AGENTS.md` "Debugging" + `repos/foldkit/packages/devtools-mcp/README.md`. Gotcha: one tab, no pinned `runtime_id`, screenshot = ground truth.

## Code shape — human guardrails (whole project, no exceptions)

Limits on what a person can hold in their head, not style. Apply to every function: view, update, command, helper, test.

- Keep nesting to ~3 levels. Deeper, extract a named function. A reader must see head and tail, know which bracket belongs to whom, and where a new argument would go.
- No exemptions for "small", "throwaway", or "just one function". Broken windows: one tolerated mess becomes the norm the whole project copies.
- Pass the slice a function uses, not the whole object (a field, not the whole `Model`). The signature is the honest dependency list; an unused parameter should lint. A whole-object parameter in a long body is a hidden global.
- At a composition point, keep every sibling call at one level of abstraction. If siblings are extracted, extract the small one too, so the parent reads as a list of named calls and their inputs.
- If a function is not scannable at a glance, extract until it is.
